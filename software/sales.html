        <h1>All your marketing tools and data — all under one roof.</h1>
        <p>
          The job is tough for modern marketers. Either you’re juggling various
          point solutions, or you’re stuck with tools that are powerful but
          impossible to use. This means scattered customer data, lackluster
          marketing, and too much time spent fussing with software. But it
          doesn’t have to be that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Marketing Hub, all your marketing tools and data are on one
          easy-to-use, powerful platform. You’ll save valuable time and get all
          the context you need to provide a personalized experience that
          attracts and converts the right customers at scale.

        <h3>Does HubSpot's marketing software integrate with Salesforce and other third-party tools?</h3>
         <p>Yes. Marketing Hub has a powerful bi-directional sync with Salesforce, which means that any changes made in one system are automatically synced to the other. You can choose which records sync from HubSpot to Salesforce and when, and automatically send important lead intelligence like email opens, form submissions, website activity, and more to your sales team so they have all the context they need to close more deals. You can also send lead scores from HubSpot to Salesforce — to help your sales team prioritize their outreach and save valuable time.

          If you’re using tools other than Salesforce, you’ll find more than 1,160 custom integrations in our App Marketplace — making it easy to connect HubSpot to your favorite tools in just a few clicks.</p>

        <h3>What reporting capabilities do I have with Marketing Hub?</h3>
        <p>With multi-touch revenue attribution reporting, you can tie all your marketing activities to each closed deal, so you can understand exactly how your marketing contributes to revenue and get credit for your whole team. You can also build custom reports to track virtually any metric in Marketing Hub, any record in your CRM, or any data from integrated apps. Your HubSpot account includes flexible dashboards that allow you to see all your data in one place, and enables you to easily share reports with stakeholders.</p>

        <h3>Can I customize the data in my Marketing Hub account?</h3>
        <p>Of course! With custom objects (available in the Enterprise edition of Marketing Hub), you have complete flexibility and control to match your CRM data to your business. You’ll have full flexibility to name the object, determine its properties, and decide what other objects it can be associated with. </p>
