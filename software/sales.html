              Marketing software helps you engage and convert leads with
              dynamic, automated campaigns across a variety of channels, and
              measure the effectiveness of your strategies. You can leverage
              marketing software to create and deliver content, deploy targeted
              ads, and build complex customer journeys. Marketing software can
              also help you collaborate better across your team and with sales
              by making it easy to organize all of your business’ marketing
              assets, data, and tools in one place. No matter the team size,
              from small business to enterprise, there is functionality within
              HubSpot’s marketing software that will supercharge your marketing
              efforts.

            How much does HubSpot's marketing software cost?

          <div class="content2">
            <p>
              HubSpot's marketing software is called Marketing Hub. You can get
              started for free with Marketing Hub's free tools, or if you’re
              looking for more advanced features to help automate and scale your
              marketing operations, HubSpot also offers premium Marketing Hub
              features in its Starter, Professional, and Enterprise editions.

            Does HubSpot's marketing software integrate with Salesforce and
            other third-party tools?
          </div>
          <div class="content2">
            <p>
              Yes. Marketing Hub has a powerful bi-directional sync with
              Salesforce, which means that any changes made in one system are
              automatically synced to the other. You can choose which records
              sync from HubSpot to Salesforce and when, and automatically send
              important lead intelligence like email opens, form submissions,
              website activity, and more to your sales team so they have all the
              context they need to close more deals. You can also send lead
              scores from HubSpot to Salesforce — to help your sales team
              prioritize their outreach and save valuable time. If you’re using
              tools other than Salesforce, you’ll find more than 1,160 custom
              integrations in our App Marketplace — making it easy to connect
              HubSpot to your favorite tools in just a few clicks.

          <div class="content2">
            <p>
              Of course! With custom objects (available in the Enterprise
              edition of Marketing Hub), you have complete flexibility and
              control to match your CRM data to your business. You’ll have full
              flexibility to name the object, determine its properties, and
              decide what other objects it can be associated with.

            How is Marketing Hub different from other marketing software?
          </div>
          <div class="content2">
            <p>
              Marketing Hub was built from the ground up as part of HubSpot's
              complete CRM platform, unlike a lot of software that’s been
              cobbled together through acquisitions — all to help our customers
              grow better. With Marketing Hub, all your marketing tools and data
              are in one place, so you won’t have to juggle multiple point
              solutions and waste valuable time stitching together reporting.
              It’s both deeply powerful and uniquely easy to use. Last but not
              least, you can easily sync Marketing Hub with more than 1,160
              custom integrations so your marketing team has all its favorite
              tools on one platform.
